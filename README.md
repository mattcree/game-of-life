# Game of Life

Simple implementation written in Javascript, late one night upon hearing of the passing of John Conway.

I've never written it before, so this was my first attempt -- figured I'd go for the simplest graphical approach 
i.e. generate a big string, stick it in a `pre` block, and see what happens when you try to make the board 2000 x 2000 (not good things)

## How to Run
TODO -- explain how to run this. Initially built this in the browser using `playcode` -- it can [be found here](https://playcode.io/673849/)
